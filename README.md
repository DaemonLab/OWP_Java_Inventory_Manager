# OWP_Java_Inventory_Manager
Tutorial under our series One Week Projects (OWP) which will focus on projects that can be made in approximately one week while still being useful. We will try to make a decent inventory management application in this tutorial. Users are expected to go through each commit and learn step by step from there. Hence a very basic understanding of git is inherent pre-requisite. But we have provided a guide for navigating this tutorial which takes care of this.  
  
This is a Java tutorial which uses MySQL for database and Swing API for GUI. This is made with Eclipse Neon IDE. The target audience is expected to have a basic knowledge of Java and SQL to go through this tutorial.  
Java is a cross-platform language, and hence this tutorial can be followed on any OS be it windows or linux. The Swing API provides a nice and simple way to create GUI for java applications. Also, MySQL is widely used database server and also provides a simple Java connector API to connect to databases from Java. Hence this database is chosen.  
  
## Navigating this tutorial
We understand that many readers might not have familiarity with the `git` framework and hence we have added a guide to explain all the required commands to properly navigate this tutorial. Please have a look at it if you are not familiar with git. The guide is a pdf file named [Navigating_OWP_Java_Inventory_Manager.pdf](Navigating_OWP_Java_Inventory_Manager.pdf) present with this tutorial.  
  
  
## Running the code
- Download and install Eclipse IDE from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads
- Download and install the latest Java Platform (JDK) from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
- Download and install MySQL Community Server from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
- Download and extract the zip/rar of MySQL Java connector from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ to any folder. We will only need the jar file from the extracted folder.
- Follow Step 1 from [Steps.md](Steps.md) to create the required database and required user account. Although it has been written as per a windows user, but linux users can use the same commands.
- Download this project or clone it using git and then open the project in Eclipse.
- Build and run to see the output.  
  
You can look at the screenshot, which will be uplaoded here when the tutorial will be complete, to get an idea of how the finished product will look like.  
  
Although the code is being provided, a learner is expected to run the code and go through the stages of how it was made. And then try him/her self to make some other software or an extension of the provided software. If you make something derived/inspired from this code, you can let us know and we can provide a link to your repository in a separate section of this readme.  
Very basic decription of each commit will be given in the file [Steps.md](Steps.md). Learners are expected to use google to learn the in-depth intricasies. These tutorials are meant to promote learning-via-coding.
